# Vision-Based Navigation System for Drones

## Overview
A vision-based autonomous navigation system for drones using computer vision and machine learning techniques.  
The system enables drones to perceive their environment, detect obstacles, and plan safe navigation paths using camera input.

This project is developed as part of an academic research effort focused on autonomous systems, AI-driven navigation, and secure system design.
