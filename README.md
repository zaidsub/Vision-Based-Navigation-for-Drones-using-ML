# Vision-Based-Navigation-for-Drones-using-ML
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable across several domains. However, their heavy reliance on GPS signals exposes them to spoofing, jamming, and denial-of-service attacks, creating risks in critical operations. In conclusion we propose a vision-based navigation framework that integrates CNNs, SLAM, and path-planning algorithms.
